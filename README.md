# Sudoku_Solver

a simple program to generate Sudoku Answer(s)

a terminal based program that will print good looking sudoku board

here I have used "*" to denote the current poisition in board and "W A S D" being the movements of 1 step

after filling numbers (1 to 9) in board, press "Y" to generate the output

if there are multiple answers it will print all of them.
